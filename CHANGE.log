1.3:  2006/11/28
  
  Obviously didn't fix the 1.2 error; hopefully now fixed.
  This was acomplished by adding a new input, etastart=NULL.

  

1.2: 2006/09/25

   Fixed an error identified by Sonja Kuhnt for Gaussian models:
   Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos) : object "etastart" not found

   

v1.1: 

   Fixed an error identified by Cristiano Amancio for binomial data:

   Error in while (abs(m2loglikold - m2loglik)/(abs(m2loglikold) + 1) > epsilon &&  :
           absent value where TRUE/FALSE necessary

   Futhermore: Warning message:
   NaNs produced in: log(x) ".
